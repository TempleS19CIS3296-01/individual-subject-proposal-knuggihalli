Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. The project is a c library to quickly implement a socket server with abstractions for user management. This library will aid developers in creating a low level socket server that can scale properly. The objective is to be able to parse JSON data via this communication protocol. 

This proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class as it is creating a resource that we as engineers can use in the future to build better software using remote procedure calls. The project uses concepts from low level and operating systems. We are experimenting with communication protocols and will require the ability to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. It will be complex and will require proper source contorol to create. Creating abstractions for user control will require parallel computing and multi-threading.

My contribution will be to create the actual socket server and build a basic mechanism for communication. This will require creating a client and server to debug with. I will also build the UML diagram and create issues related to the creation of this library. This way I will be able to aid in the user abstraction design. I will require resource to help me build a JSON parser and create the multi threaded interface.
